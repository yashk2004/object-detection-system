# Object Detection System

The **Object Detection System** is a Python-based project that utilizes machine learning models to detect and classify objects in images. The system can identify multiple objects such as apples, cars, cats, and people, as shown below.

## Features
- Detects and classifies objects in images.
- Supports multiple classes (e.g., fruits, animals, vehicles, and humans).
- Displays confidence scores for each detection.
- Easily customizable and extendable for different object classes.

## Example Outputs
Below is an example of the object detection system in action:

### Detected Objects:
1. **Image 1:** Apples detected with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
2. **Image 2:** Cars and people detected in an urban scene.
3. **Image 3:** Cats detected with varying confidence levels.
4. **Image 4:** People identified in a group photo.
